## Description of Dataset
After a thorough investigation of datasets provided by data.gov, our team made a unanimous decision to analyze the reported hate crimes in the city of San Francisco. The San Francisco Police Department provided this dataset, which reveals information regarding hate crime investigations as early as 2001 and was last updated in November 2023. This dataset contains a total of 1,694 rows of data (instances of hate crimes) and contains 22 columns (attributes, facts) regarding each hate crime report. During this analysis, our team has chosen to investigate the trends of hate crime over time utilizing the “occurence_month” attribute, which lists the occurrence of each instance by month and year. In addition to “occurence_month”, we also used the number of hate crime reports by a count of each report’s primary key, “record_id”. Furthermore, the team has investigated the percentage of total hate crimes based on racial bias through the utilization of the “most_serious_bias” attribute and count of “record_id”’s. This attribute depicts the variations of bias reports under the dataset. This enabled our team to conduct a multi-dimensional investigation regarding racial hate crime trends that occurred amidst the lifting of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. Lastly, our team has also inspected the distribution of different types of offenses in various locations of San Francisco through the combination of  “most_serious_ucr”, “most_serious_location”, “most_serious_bias”, and “record_id” attributes. “Most_serious_ucr” can be described as the most serious crime (offense) that occurred in the hate crime incident. “Most_serious_location” describes the location associated with each instance of hate crime. Following this, our team will offer a more detailed description of our findings derived from the analysis based on our following questions.


## Question 1 
**How have hate crime incidents of different bias types investigated by the police department changed over time in San Francisco?**  
This question aims to determine any trends or spikes in the number of crimes against certain bias types. Investigating these trends and spikes will help the San Francisco Police Department better understand the contextual factors that may have influenced these spikes. This information is important as it can be used to understand the current social trends around crimes and how they have developed over time. For example, if the count of crimes against a certain bias type decreases throughout the years it could be representative of that group being more accepted. This knowledge gained can be used by the police department to better predict the number of crimes for the following years, as well as developing protocols for responding to hate crime issues following catastrophic events. This question and its findings are related to the dataset, which is full of data regarding hate crimes investigated by the San Francisco Police Department since 2001.

This graph displays the count of hate crimes categorized by bias type from 2001-2023. According to the graph, hate crimes related to race, ethnicity, and ancestry display the highest count consistently each year, with crimes related to sexual orientation following in second. This graph reveals a prominent spike in race-related crimes during the years 2020-2021. The spike in the number of crimes is so great that it was not due to normal variance, rather a major event influenced it. One event that could likely be tied to this spike is the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in widespread panic throughout the nation. Another significant trend is established by observing the sexual orientation bias type. Unlike the other bias types, which fluctuate and remain mostly unchanged by 2023, the count of hate crimes against the sexual orientation bias type experiences a steady decrease over from 2001-2023. This could be a result of LBTQ+ growing in support and legal protection from the government. The San Francisco police department can use this to help forecast future years. For example, they could dedicate more research towards a different bias type to better assist that group while maintaining this decreasing trend for crimes against sexual orientation. Overall, this graph is important for the San Francisco Police Department to understand their community and the people most at danger.

**In light of the rise in racially biased hate crime incidents in 2021, how has the timing of this spike been during the COVID-19 pandemic specifically influenced the trends in racially biased hate crimes in San Francisco?**  
This question regarding the spike in racially biased hate crimes in San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic is significant for multiple reasons. Socially, it highlights the intersection of public health crises and societal attitudes, particularly the impact of widespread fear and misinformation on minority communities. Economically, such trends in hate crimes can have a ripple effect on local businesses and the overall economy, especially in diverse cities like San Francisco. Culturally, it reflects on how emergencies can exacerbate underlying prejudices, influencing the cultural fabric of a city known for its inclusivity. The data sets pertaining to hate crimes and COVID-19 incidences provide a crucial context for understanding these trends. They offer empirical evidence to track the correlation between the pandemic and an increase in hate crimes, thus helping in formulating informed policies and community responses to address and mitigate such issues.

These graphs based on the dataset were able to give us key insight into what specific races were most affected by the spike in racial-bias hate crimes in 2021. As seen in the data visualizations, the group that saw a disproportionate percentage of racial hate crimes were Asian-Americans. The main reason why our group believes the data is skewed this way is due to anti-asian sentiment following the COVID-19 epidemic. There were a lot of people that attributed the pandemic to the Asian population, especially the Chinese community, and as a result there was a lot of negative sentiment towards this group. According to a study done by the LA times, hate crimes against Asian-Americans in California increased by 177.5% from 2020 to 2021. Being that the data is from 2021, directly following the brunt of the pandemic, restrictions on social distancing were lifted and we believe people were able to go out in society and commit hate crimes they were not able to do while quarantined. Behind Asian-Americans, African-Americans saw the second highest percentage of hate crimes. We believe this can be attributed with left over racial tensions following protests against police brutality in 2020, however it should be noted that this percentage is significantly less than experienced by Asian-Americans.


## Question 2
**What is the distribution of different types of offense categories in hate crimes across various locations in San Francisco?**  
Our second question highlights what specific locations certain offenses tend to occur. Understanding this distribution enables the San Francisco Police Department to tailor their strategies and resources more effectively. For instance,certain offenses like assault are found to be more common in highways and alleys, the police can allocate more resources or implement targeted community outreach programs in those areas. This strategic deployment of resources not only aids in crime prevention but also helps in building community trust and awareness. Additionally, identifying hotspots for specific hate crime offenses can guide public safety campaigns and inform residents about the safety measures they can take. The follow-up question, focusing on the spikes in hate crime incidents in 2001 and 2021, further deepens the understanding of the temporal dynamics of these crimes, allowing for a more nuanced and effective response from law enforcement and community stakeholders.

The analysis of hate crime offense distributions across San Francisco critical insights for law enforcement and community safety initiatives. Highways and roads are identified as primary places for assault-related hate crimes, whereas residential settings are more susceptible to intimidation and vandalism offenses. This information is important for the San Francisco Police Department to deploy resources strategically and to enhance preventive measures. Increased surveillance and patrol frequency in public spaces may act as a deterrent against violent offenses, while intensified community policing could reduce crimes targeting personal security and property in residential zones. The data also provide a lens through which the social and economic repercussions of these crimes can be viewed, with implications for community welfare and the vitality of neighborhood economies. By examining these patterns, the San Francisco Police Department is equipped to implement predictive policing and allocate resources to reduce potential hate crimes. This approach is crucial for safeguarding the communities within San Francisco.

**Given the significant number of hate crimes reported on highways and roads, what are the predominant types of hate crime biases (such as race, religion, sexual orientation) and types of offense acts observed in these specific locations?**  
This follow-up question is focuses in on the types of hate crime bias that occurs on specifically highways, roads, alleys, and streets. Looking at this question will help the San Francisco Police Department to reduce hate crimes biases by focusing on the biases that are most prevalent in the hate crimes that occur on these locations. The San Francisco Police Department can focus its attention on those crimes on highways and roads to significantly reduce the number of hate crimes that occur in the city. The data will help to understand which group of people are most affected by the hate crimes. Additionally, it has implications for social cohesion and the safety perception of travelers, particularly those belonging to vulnerable groups, impacting the overall sense of security and community trust in these areas. The dataset consists of all hate crimes based on bias that have occurred since 2001, and so it provides an overall trend to show which types of hate crimes are occuring around highways and roads.
<img width="1174" alt="image" src="https://github.com/angelmichallet/MIST-4610-Project-2/assets/130924513/338e6c27-02e2-42db-9b7f-f742dc320eee">
The graph above is a bar graph where the number of hate crimes in San Francisco since 2001 are listed by hate crime bias. When analyzing data on hate crime bias on highways or roads, we can see that there is significant anti-gay bias in the hate crimes that occurred since 2001. Over 220 out of the over 700 hate crimes on San Francisco highways and roads had significant anti-gay bias. Notably, the most common types of offenses within this category are simple assault and aggravated assault. Simple assault generally involves minor physical or verbal harm without significant physical injury or the use of a weapon, while aggravated assault typically involves more severe physical harm, use of a weapon, or an attack that results in serious bodily injury. The prevalence of these assaults as hate crimes against gay males on highways points to a serious concern for the safety of this community in such locations. It suggests a need for heightened awareness and protective measures, as well as targeted law enforcement training to address and prevent such violent hate crimes. The data also highlights the necessity for societal education to combat homophobic attitudes that may lead to such offenses. The graph shows major anti-Black and anti-Asian hate crime bias on highways and roads as well. This can be another major focus of the San Francisco Police Department, as well, to prevent hate crimes towards these groups.

## Manipulations Applied to the Dataset for Analysis
We did not need to apply any manipulations to the dataset itself, as our data meets the expectations of being quantifiable, measurable information that aligns with the standards of being meaningful and interpretable. Additionally, our dataset is free from duplicates, irrelevant or redundant entries, and any low-quality data. However, for relevance, we did need to apply filters on our data based on the focus of each of our graphs.

**Visualization #1 (Bias Types of Hate Crimes 2001-2023)**
- Filter on Most Serious Bias (The explicit bias motivation behind the most serious crime committed for the hate crime incident): Data was sorted to exclude Anti-Multiple Races (Group), Anti-Multiple Religions (Group), Anti-Other Christian, Anti-Other Race/Ethnicity/Ancestry, and Anti-Other Religion from the data analyzed in the line graph. This is driven by the need to concentrate on clear-cut instances of bias that present less ambiguity. Ambiguous categories can pose significant challenges for analysis, as the motivations behind hate crimes in these groups may be complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to draw distinct conclusions or identify clear trends. By filtering out these complex categories, we can focus on more straightforward cases where the primary bias is against a single group. 

**Visualization #2 (Number of Racially Biased Hate Crimes Over 2021, Percentages of Hate Crimes based on Racial Biases in 2021)**
- Filter on Year: Data was sorted to only include 2021 for analysis because our focus here was to look into the details of hate crimes from the spike in racially motivated hate crimes in 2021, as seen in Visualization #1. Such a temporal focus is essential for understanding the dynamics of hate crimes in the context of an extraordinary event and for assessing whether the patterns observed were a direct consequence of the pandemic-related factors or part of a longer-term trend.
- Filter on Most Serious Bias: Data was sorted to include only Anti-Asian, Anti-Black or African American, Anti-Hispanic or Latino, and Anti-White biases. By narrowing the focus to these specific biases, the graph gives a clearer view of the crimes that were most prevalent and most serious in the social climate of that year. Anti-Arab is excluded from the filtering only because there are no recorded Anti-Arab biased hate crimes in San Francisco in 2021.

**Visualization #3 (Count of Offense Types at Various Locations)**
- Filter on Most Serious Location (The location associated with the most serious crime committed for the hate crime incident): Data was sorted to exclude locations that have record counts of less than 3. Statistically, these outliers might not provide enough evidence to indicate a trend or pattern as compared to the many other categories of location data, thereby skewing the analysis and potentially drawing attention away from areas with more significant data. Visually, the exclusion simplifies the chart, making it easier to digest and interpret by emphasizing locations where offenses occur more frequently. We also excluded “Other/Unknown” locations because this ambiguous category wouldn’t be possible to explain any data about.

**Visualization #4 (Types of Hate Crime Biases and Offense Types on Highways/Roads)**
- Filter on Most Serious Location: Data was sorted to only include records from the “Highway/Road/Alley/Street” category, because the focus analysis here is based on the overwhelming number of incidents at this location, as seen in Visualization #3.
